fix_commit_message: 'sysfs: turn WARN() into pr_warn()


  It''s not good to crash the machine if panic_on_warn() is set just

  because someone made a stupid mistake of trying to create a sysfs file

  with the same name of an existing one.  This makes the automated testing

  tools a lot harder to find the real bugs in the kernel.


  So just print a warning out and dump the stack to get the attention of

  the developer that they did something foolish.  Then keep on trucking,

  as this should not be a fatal error at all.
