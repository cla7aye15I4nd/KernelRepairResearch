fix_commit_message: 'udf: Fix uninitialized array access for some pathnames


  For filenames that begin with . and are between 2 and 5 characters long,

  UDF charset conversion code would read uninitialized memory in the

  output buffer. The only practical impact is that the name may be prepended a

  "unification hash" when it is not actually needed but still it is good

  to fix this.
