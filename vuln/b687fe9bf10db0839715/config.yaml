fix_commit_message: 'Revert "tty: n_gsm: avoid call of sleeping functions from atomic
  context"


  This reverts commit 902e02ea9385373ce4b142576eef41c642703955.


  The above commit is reverted as the usage of tx_mutex seems not to solve

  the problem described in 902e02ea9385 ("tty: n_gsm: avoid call of sleeping

  functions from atomic context") and just moves the bug to another place.
