fix_commit_message: 'binder: Remove bogus warning on failed same-process transaction


  While binder transactions with the same binder_proc as sender and recipient

  are forbidden, transactions with the same task_struct as sender and

  recipient are possible (even though currently there is a weird check in

  binder_transaction() that rejects them in the target==0 case).

  Therefore, task_struct identities can''t be used to distinguish whether

  the caller is running in the context of the sender or the recipient.


  Since I see no easy way to make this WARN_ON() useful and correct, let''s

  just remove it.
