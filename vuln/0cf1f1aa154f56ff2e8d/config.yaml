fix_commit_message: 'ANDROID: binder: prevent transactions into own process.


  This can''t happen with normal nodes (because you can''t get a ref

  to a node you own), but it could happen with the context manager;

  to make the behavior consistent with regular nodes, reject

  transactions into the context manager by the process owning it.
