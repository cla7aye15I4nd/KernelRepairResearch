fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: control led: fix memory leak in snd_ctl_led_register


  The snd_ctl_led_sysfs_add and snd_ctl_led_sysfs_remove should contain

  the refcount operations in pair. However, snd_ctl_led_sysfs_remove fails

  to decrease the refcount to zero, which causes device_release never to

  be invoked. This leads to memory leak to some resources, like struct

  device_private. In addition, we also free some other similar memory

  leaks in snd_ctl_led_init/snd_ctl_led_exit.


  Fix this by replacing device_del to device_unregister

  in snd_ctl_led_sysfs_remove/snd_ctl_led_init/snd_ctl_led_exit.


  Note that, when CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE is enabled, put_device will

  call kobject_release and delay the release of kobject, which will cause

  use-after-free when the memory backing the kobject is freed at once.
