fix_commit_message: 'fs/locks: always delete_block after waiting.


  Now that requests can block other requests, we

  need to be careful to always clean up those blocked

  requests.

  Any time that we wait for a request, we might have

  other requests attached, and when we stop waiting,

  we must clean them up.

  If the lock was granted, the requests might have been

  moved to the new lock, though when merged with a

  pre-exiting lock, this might not happen.

  In all cases we don''t want blocked locks to remain

  attached, so we remove them to be safe.
