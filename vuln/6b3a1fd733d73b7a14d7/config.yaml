fix_commit_message: 'virtio: Revert "virtio: find_vqs() add arg sizes"


  This reverts commit a10fba0377145fccefea4dc4dd5915b7ed87e546: the

  proposed API isn''t supported on all transports but no

  effort was made to address this.


  It might not be hard to fix if we want to: maybe just

  rename size to size_hint and make sure legacy

  transports ignore the hint.


  But it''s not sure what the benefit is in any case, so

  let''s drop it.
