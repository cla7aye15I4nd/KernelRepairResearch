fix_commit_message: 'filldir[64]: remove WARN_ON_ONCE() for bad directory entries


  This was always meant to be a temporary thing, just for testing and to

  see if it actually ever triggered.


  The only thing that reported it was syzbot doing disk image fuzzing, and

  then that warning is expected.  So let''s just remove it before -rc4,

  because the extra sanity testing should probably go to -stable, but we

  don''t want the warning to do so.
