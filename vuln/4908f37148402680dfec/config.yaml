fix_commit_message: 'bcachefs: Don''t build aux search tree when still repairing node


  bch2_btree_node_drop_keys_outside_node() will (re)build aux search

  trees, because it''s also called by topology repair.


  bch2_btree_node_read_done() was calling it before validating individual

  keys; invalid ones have to be dropped.


  If we call drop_keys_outside_node() first, then

  bch2_bset_build_aux_tree() doesn''t run because the node already has an

  aux search tree - which was invalidated by the repair.
