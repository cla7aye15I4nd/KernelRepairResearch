fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: usb-audio: Fix copy&paste error in the validator


  The recently introduced USB-audio descriptor validator had a stupid

  copy&paste error that may lead to an unexpected overlook of too short

  descriptors for processing and extension units.  It''s likely the cause

  of the report triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.  Let''s fix it.
