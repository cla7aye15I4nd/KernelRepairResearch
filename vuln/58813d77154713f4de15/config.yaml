fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: timer: Revert active callback sync check at close


  This is essentially a revert of the commit a7588c896b05 ("ALSA: timer:

  Check ack_list emptiness instead of bit flag").  The intended change

  by the commit turns out to be insufficient, as snd_timer_close*()

  always calls snd_timer_stop() that deletes the ack_list beforehand.


  In theory, we can change the behavior of snd_timer_stop() to sync the

  pending ack_list, but this will become a deadlock for the callback

  like sequencer that calls again snd_timer_stop() from itself.  So,

  reverting the change is a more straightforward solution.
