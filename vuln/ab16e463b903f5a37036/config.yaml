fix_commit_message: 'batman-adv: Avoid uninitialized chaddr when handling DHCP


  The gateway client code can try to optimize the delivery of DHCP packets to

  avoid broadcasting them through the whole mesh. But also transmissions to

  the client can be optimized by looking up the destination via the chaddr of

  the DHCP packet.


  But the chaddr is currently only done when chaddr is fully inside the

  non-paged area of the skbuff. Otherwise it will not be initialized and the

  unoptimized path should have been taken.


  But the implementation didn''t handle this correctly. It didn''t retrieve the

  correct chaddr but still tried to perform the TT lookup with this

  uninitialized memory.
