fix_commit_message: 'hugetlbfs: prevent filesystem stacking of hugetlbfs


  syzbot found issues with having hugetlbfs on a union/overlay as reported

  in [1].  Due to the limitations (no write) and special functionality of

  hugetlbfs, it does not work well in filesystem stacking.  There are no

  know use cases for hugetlbfs stacking.  Rather than making modifications

  to get hugetlbfs working in such environments, simply prevent stacking.
