fix_commit_message: 'fsverity: reject FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY on mode 3 fds


  Commit 56124d6c87fd ("fsverity: support enabling with tree block size <

  PAGE_SIZE") changed FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY to use __kernel_read() to read

  the file''s data, instead of direct pagecache accesses.


  An unintended consequence of this is that the

  ''WARN_ON_ONCE(!(file->f_mode & FMODE_READ))'' in __kernel_read() became

  reachable by fuzz tests.  This happens if FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY is called

  on a fd opened with access mode 3, which means "ioctl access only".


  Arguably, FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY should work on ioctl-only fds.  But

  ioctl-only fds are a weird Linux extension that is rarely used and that

  few people even know about.  (The documentation for FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY

  even specifically says it requires O_RDONLY.)  It''s probably not

  worthwhile to make the ioctl internally open a new fd just to handle

  this case.  Thus, just reject the ioctl on such fds for now.
