fix_commit_message: 'media: v4l2-ctrls.c/uvc: zero v4l2_event


  Control events can leak kernel memory since they do not fully zero the

  event. The same code is present in both v4l2-ctrls.c and uvc_ctrl.c, so

  fix both.


  It appears that all other event code is properly zeroing the structure,

  it''s these two places.
