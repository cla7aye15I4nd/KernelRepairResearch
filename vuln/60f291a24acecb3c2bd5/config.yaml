fix_commit_message: 'udf: Do not bother merging very long extents


  When merging very long extents we try to push as much length as possible

  to the first extent. However this is unnecessarily complicated and not

  really worth the trouble. Furthermore there was a bug in the logic

  resulting in corrupting extents in the file as syzbot reproducer shows.

  So just don''t bother with the merging of extents that are too long

  together.
