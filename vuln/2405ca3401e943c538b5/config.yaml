fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: usb-audio: Fix OOB access of mixer element list


  The USB-audio mixer code holds a linked list of usb_mixer_elem_list,

  and several operations are performed for each mixer element.  A few of

  them (snd_usb_mixer_notify_id() and snd_usb_mixer_interrupt_v2())

  assume each mixer element being a usb_mixer_elem_info object that is a

  subclass of usb_mixer_elem_list, cast via container_of() and access it

  members.  This may result in an out-of-bound access when a

  non-standard list element has been added, as spotted by syzkaller

  recently.


  This patch adds a new field, is_std_info, in usb_mixer_elem_list to

  indicate that the element is the usb_mixer_elem_info type or not, and

  skip the access to such an element if needed.
