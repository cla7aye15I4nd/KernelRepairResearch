fix_commit_message: 'ext4: allocate extended attribute value in vmalloc area


  Now, extended attribute value maximum length is 64K. The memory

  requested here does not need continuous physical addresses, so it is

  appropriate to use kvmalloc to request memory. At the same time, it

  can also cope with the situation that the extended attribute will

  become longer in the future.
