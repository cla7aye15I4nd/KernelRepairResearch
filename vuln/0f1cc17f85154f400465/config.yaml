fix_commit_message: 'io-wq: wait for io_wq_create() to setup necessary workers


  We currently have a race where if setup is really slow, we can be

  calling io_wq_destroy() before we''re done setting up. This will cause

  the caller to get stuck waiting for the manager to set things up, but

  the manager already exited.


  Fix this by doing a sync setup of the manager. This also fixes the case

  where if we failed creating workers, we''d also get stuck.


  In practice this race window was really small, as we already wait for

  the manager to start. Hence someone would have to call io_wq_destroy()

  after the task has started, but before it started the first loop. The

  reported test case forked tons of these, which is why it became an

  issue.
