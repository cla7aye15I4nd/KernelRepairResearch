fix_commit_message: 'mm/vma: reset VMA iterator on commit_merge() OOM failure


  While an OOM failure in commit_merge() isn''t really feasible due to the

  allocation which might fail (a maple tree pre-allocation) being ''too small

  to fail'', we do need to handle this case correctly regardless.


  In vma_merge_existing_range(), we can theoretically encounter failures

  which result in an OOM error in two ways - firstly dup_anon_vma() might

  fail with an OOM error, and secondly commit_merge() failing, ultimately,

  to pre-allocate a maple tree node.


  The abort logic for dup_anon_vma() resets the VMA iterator to the initial

  range, ensuring that any logic looping on this iterator will correctly

  proceed to the next VMA.


  However the commit_merge() abort logic does not do the same thing.  This

  resulted in a syzbot report occurring because mlockall() iterates through

  VMAs, is tolerant of errors, but ended up with an incorrect previous VMA

  being specified due to incorrect iterator state.


  While making this change, it became apparent we are duplicating logic -

  the logic introduced in commit 41e6ddcaa0f1 ("mm/vma: add give_up_on_oom

  option on modify/merge, use in uffd release") duplicates the

  vmg->give_up_on_oom check in both abort branches.


  Additionally, we observe that we can perform the anon_dup check safely on

  dup_anon_vma() failure, as this will not be modified should this call

  fail.


  Finally, we need to reset the iterator in both cases, so now we can simply

  use the exact same code to abort for both.


  We remove the VM_WARN_ON(err != -ENOMEM) as it would be silly for this to

  be otherwise and it allows us to implement the abort check more neatly.
