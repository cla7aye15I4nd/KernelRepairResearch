fix_commit_message: 'vfs: Add a single-or-reconfig keying to vfs_get_super()


  Add an additional keying mode to vfs_get_super() to indicate that only a

  single superblock should exist in the system, and that, if it does, further

  mounts should invoke reconfiguration upon it.


  This allows mount_single() to be replaced.


  [Fix by Eric Biggers folded in]
