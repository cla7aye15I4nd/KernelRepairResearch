fix_commit_message: 'xfs: fix mount failure crash on invalid iclog memory access


  syzbot (via KASAN) reports a use-after-free in the error path of

  xlog_alloc_log(). Specifically, the iclog freeing loop doesn''t

  handle the case of a fully initialized ->l_iclog linked list.

  Instead, it assumes that the list is partially constructed and NULL

  terminated.


  This bug manifested because there was no possible error scenario

  after iclog list setup when the original code was added.  Subsequent

  code and associated error conditions were added some time later,

  while the original error handling code was never updated. Fix up the

  error loop to terminate either on a NULL iclog or reaching the end

  of the list.
