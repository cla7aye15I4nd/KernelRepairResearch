fix_commit_message: 'Abort file_remove_privs() for non-reg. files


  file_remove_privs() might be called for non-regular files, e.g.

  blkdev inode. There is no reason to do its job on things

  like blkdev inodes, pipes, or cdevs. Hence, abort if

  file does not refer to a regular inode.


  AV: more to the point, for devices there might be any number of

  inodes refering to given device.  Which one to strip the permissions

  from, even if that made any sense in the first place?  All of them

  will be observed with contents modified, after all.
