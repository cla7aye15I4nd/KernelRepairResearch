fix_commit_message: 'USB: yurex: Fix protection fault after device removal


  The syzkaller USB fuzzer found a general-protection-fault bug in the

  yurex driver.  The fault occurs when a device has been unplugged; the

  driver''s interrupt-URB handler logs an error message referring to the

  device by name, after the device has been unregistered and its name

  deallocated.


  This problem is caused by the fact that the interrupt URB isn''t

  cancelled until the driver''s private data structure is released, which

  can happen long after the device is gone.  The cure is to make sure

  that the interrupt URB is killed before yurex_disconnect() returns;

  this is exactly the sort of thing that usb_poison_urb() was meant for.
