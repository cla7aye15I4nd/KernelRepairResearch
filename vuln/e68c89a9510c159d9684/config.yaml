fix_commit_message: 'profiling: fix shift-out-of-bounds bugs


  Syzbot reported shift-out-of-bounds bug in profile_init().

  The problem was in incorrect prof_shift. Since prof_shift value comes from

  userspace we need to clamp this value into [0, BITS_PER_LONG -1]

  boundaries.


  Second possible shiht-out-of-bounds was found by Tetsuo:

  sample_step local variable in read_profile() had "unsigned int" type,

  but prof_shift allows to make a BITS_PER_LONG shift. So, to prevent

  possible shiht-out-of-bounds sample_step type was changed to

  "unsigned long".


  Also, "unsigned short int" will be sufficient for storing

  [0, BITS_PER_LONG] value, that''s why there is no need for

  "unsigned long" prof_shift.
