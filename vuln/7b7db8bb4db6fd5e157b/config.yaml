fix_commit_message: 'KVM: VMX: do not use uninitialized gfn_to_hva_cache


  An uninitialized gfn_to_hva_cache has ghc->len == 0, which causes

  the accessors to croak very loudly.  While a BUG_ON is definitely

  _too_ loud and a bug on its own, there is indeed an issue of using

  the caches in such a way that they could not have been initialized,

  because ghc->gpa == 0 might match and thus kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init

  would not be called.


  For the vmcs12_cache, the solution is simply to invoke

  kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init unconditionally: we already know

  that the cache does not match the current VMCS pointer.

  For the shadow_vmcs12_cache, there is no similar condition

  that checks the VMCS link pointer, so invalidate the cache

  on VMXON.
