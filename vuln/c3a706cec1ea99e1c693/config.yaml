fix_commit_message: 'drm: Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique()


  There is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due

  to retrieving file_priv->master prior to locking the device''s master

  mutex.


  An example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error

  found by Syzbot:

  https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803


  In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is

  because another process had acquired the device''s master mutex in

  drm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv->master in

  drm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv->master was subsequently

  freed before the mutex was unlocked.


  To fix this, we lock the device''s master mutex before retrieving the

  pointer from from fpriv->master. This patch passes the Syzbot

  reproducer test.
