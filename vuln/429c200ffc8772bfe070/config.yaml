fix_commit_message: 'net/x25: fix nonblocking connect


  This patch fixes 2 issues in x25_connect():


  1. It makes absolutely no sense to reset the neighbour and the

  connection state after a (successful) nonblocking call of x25_connect.

  This prevents any connection from being established, since the response

  (call accept) cannot be processed.


  2. Any further calls to x25_connect() while a call is pending should

  simply return, instead of creating new Call Request (on different

  logical channels).


  This patch should also fix the "KASAN: null-ptr-deref Write in

  x25_connect" and "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference

  in x25_connect" bugs reported by syzbot.
