fix_commit_message: 'HID: betop: fix slab-out-of-bounds Write in betop_probe


  Syzbot reported slab-out-of-bounds Write bug in hid-betopff driver.

  The problem is the driver assumes the device must have an input report but

  some malicious devices violate this assumption.


  So this patch checks hid_device''s input is non empty before it''s been used.
