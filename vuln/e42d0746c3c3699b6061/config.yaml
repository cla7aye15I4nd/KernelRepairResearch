fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: info: Drop WARN_ON() from buffer NULL sanity check


  snd_info_get_line() has a sanity check of NULL buffer -- both buffer

  itself being NULL and buffer->buffer being NULL.  Basically both

  checks are valid and necessary, but the problem is that it''s with

  snd_BUG_ON() macro that triggers WARN_ON().  The latter condition

  (NULL buffer->buffer) can be met arbitrarily by user since the buffer

  is allocated at the first write, so it means that user can trigger

  WARN_ON() at will.


  This patch addresses it by simply moving buffer->buffer NULL check out

  of snd_BUG_ON() so that spurious WARNING is no longer triggered.
