fix_commit_message: 'xfrm: policy: fix infinite loop when merging src-nodes


  With very small change to test script we can trigger softlockup due to

  bogus assignment of ''p'' (policy to be examined) on restart.


  Previously the two to-be-merged nodes had same address/prefixlength pair,

  so no erase/reinsert was necessary, we only had to append the list from

  node a to b.


  If prefix lengths are different, the node has to be deleted and re-inserted

  into the tree, with the updated prefix length.  This was broken; due to

  bogus update to ''p'' this loops forever.


  Add a ''restart'' label and use that instead.


  While at it, don''t perform the unneeded reinserts of the policies that

  are already sorted into the ''new'' node.


  A previous patch in this series made xfrm_policy_inexact_list_reinsert()

  use the relative position indicator to sort policies according to age in

  case priorities are identical.
