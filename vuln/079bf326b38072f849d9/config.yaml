fix_commit_message: 'sctp: not bind the socket in sctp_connect


  Now when sctp_connect() is called with a wrong sa_family, it binds

  to a port but doesn''t set bp->port, then sctp_get_af_specific will

  return NULL and sctp_connect() returns -EINVAL.


  Then if sctp_bind() is called to bind to another port, the last

  port it has bound will leak due to bp->port is NULL by then.


  sctp_connect() doesn''t need to bind ports, as later __sctp_connect

  will do it if bp->port is NULL. So remove it from sctp_connect().

  While at it, remove the unnecessary sockaddr.sa_family len check

  as it''s already done in sctp_inet_connect.
