fix_commit_message: 'pipe: Remove assertion from pipe_poll()


  An assertion check was added to pipe_poll() to make sure that the ring

  occupancy isn''t seen to overflow the ring size.  However, since no locks

  are held when the three values are read, it is possible for F_SETPIPE_SZ

  to intervene and muck up the calculation, thereby causing the oops.


  Fix this by simply removing the assertion and accepting that the

  calculation might be approximate.


  Note that the previous code also had a similar issue, though there was

  no assertion check, since the occupancy counter and the ring size were

  not read with a lock held, so it''s possible that the poll check might

  have malfunctioned then too.


  Also wake up all the waiters so that they can reissue their checks if

  there was a competing read or write.


  Fixes: 8cefc107ca54 ("pipe: Use head and tail pointers for the ring, not cursor
  and length")
