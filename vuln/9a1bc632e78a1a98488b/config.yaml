fix_commit_message: 'sctp: fix err handling of stream initialization


  The fix on 951c6db954a1 fixed the issued reported there but introduced

  another. When the allocation fails within sctp_stream_init() it is

  okay/necessary to free the genradix. But it is also called when adding

  new streams, from sctp_send_add_streams() and

  sctp_process_strreset_addstrm_in() and in those situations it cannot

  just free the genradix because by then it is a fully operational

  association.


  The fix here then is to only free the genradix in sctp_stream_init()

  and on those other call sites  move on with what it already had and let

  the subsequent error handling to handle it.


  Tested with the reproducers from this report and the previous one,

  with lksctp-tools and sctp-tests.
