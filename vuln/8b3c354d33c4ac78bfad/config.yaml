fix_commit_message: 'binder: prevent transactions to context manager from its own
  process.


  Currently, a transaction to context manager from its own process

  is prevented by checking if its binder_proc struct is the same as

  that of the sender. However, this would not catch cases where the

  process opens the binder device again and uses the new fd to send

  a transaction to the context manager.
