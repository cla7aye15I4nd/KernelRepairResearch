fix_commit_message: 'mm/oom_kill.c: prevent a race between process_mrelease and exit_mmap


  Race between process_mrelease and exit_mmap, where free_pgtables is

  called while __oom_reap_task_mm is in progress, leads to kernel crash

  during pte_offset_map_lock call.  oom-reaper avoids this race by setting

  MMF_OOM_VICTIM flag and causing exit_mmap to take and release

  mmap_write_lock, blocking it until oom-reaper releases mmap_read_lock.


  Reusing MMF_OOM_VICTIM for process_mrelease would be the simplest way to

  fix this race, however that would be considered a hack.  Fix this race

  by elevating mm->mm_users and preventing exit_mmap from executing until

  process_mrelease is finished.  Patch slightly refactors the code to

  adapt for a possible mmget_not_zero failure.


  This fix has considerable negative impact on process_mrelease

  performance and will likely need later optimization.
