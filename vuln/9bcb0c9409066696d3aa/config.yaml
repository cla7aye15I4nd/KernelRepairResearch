fix_commit_message: 'can: af_can: prevent potential access of uninitialized member
  in can_rcv()


  In can_rcv(), cfd->len is uninitialized when skb->len = 0, and this

  uninitialized cfd->len is accessed nonetheless by pr_warn_once().


  Fix this uninitialized variable access by checking cfd->len''s validity

  condition (cfd->len > CAN_MAX_DLEN) separately after the skb->len''s

  condition is checked, and appropriately modify the log messages that

  are generated as well.

  In case either of the required conditions fail, the skb is freed and

  NET_RX_DROP is returned, same as before.


  Fixes: 8cb68751c115 ("can: af_can: can_rcv(): replace WARN_ONCE by pr_warn_once")
