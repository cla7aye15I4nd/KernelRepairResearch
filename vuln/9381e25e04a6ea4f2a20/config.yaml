fix_commit_message: 'fbcon: remove soft scrollback code


  This (and the VGA soft scrollback) turns out to have various nasty small

  special cases that nobody really is willing to fight.  The soft

  scrollback code was really useful a few decades ago when you typically

  used the console interactively as the main way to interact with the

  machine, but that just isn''t the case any more.


  So it''s not worth dragging along.
