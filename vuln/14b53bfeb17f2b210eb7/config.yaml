fix_commit_message: 'HID: sony: Fix memory corruption issue on cleanup.


  The sony driver is not properly cleaning up from potential failures in

  sony_input_configured. Currently it calls hid_hw_stop, while hid_connect

  is still running. This is not a good idea, instead hid_hw_stop should

  be moved to sony_probe. Similar changes were recently made to Logitech

  drivers, which were also doing improper cleanup.
