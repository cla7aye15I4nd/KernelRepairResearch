fix_commit_message: 'io_uring: fix memory leak of UNIX domain socket inode


  Opening and closing an io_uring instance leaks a UNIX domain socket

  inode.  This is because the ->file of the io_uring instance''s internal

  UNIX domain socket is set to point to the io_uring file, but then

  sock_release() sees the non-NULL ->file and assumes the inode reference

  is held by the file so doesn''t call iput().  That''s not the case here,

  since the reference is still meant to be held by the socket; the actual

  inode of the io_uring file is different.


  Fix this leak by NULL-ing out ->file before releasing the socket.
