fix_commit_message: 'ext2: Add sanity checks for group and filesystem size


  Add sanity check that filesystem size does not exceed the underlying

  device size and that group size is big enough so that metadata can fit

  into it. This avoid trying to mount some crafted filesystems with

  extremely large group counts.
