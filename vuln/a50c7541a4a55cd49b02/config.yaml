fix_commit_message: 'hugetlbfs: revert "Use i_mmap_rwsem to fix page fault/truncate
  race"


  This reverts c86aa7bbfd5568ba8a82d3635d8f7b8a8e06fe54


  The reverted commit caused ABBA deadlocks when file migration raced with

  file eviction for specific hugetlbfs files.  This was discovered with a

  modified version of the LTP move_pages12 test.


  The purpose of the reverted patch was to close a long existing race

  between hugetlbfs file truncation and page faults.  After more analysis

  of the patch and impacted code, it was determined that i_mmap_rwsem can

  not be used for all required synchronization.  Therefore, revert this

  patch while working an another approach to the underlying issue.
