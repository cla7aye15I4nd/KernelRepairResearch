fix_commit_message: 'xsk: Fix possible crash in socket_release when out-of-memory


  Fix possible crash in socket_release when an out-of-memory error has

  occurred in the bind call. If a socket using the XDP_SHARED_UMEM flag

  encountered an error in xp_create_and_assign_umem, the bind code

  jumped to the exit routine but erroneously forgot to set the err value

  before jumping. This meant that the exit routine thought the setup

  went well and set the state of the socket to XSK_BOUND. The xsk socket

  release code will then, at application exit, think that this is a

  properly setup socket, when it is not, leading to a crash when all

  fields in the socket have in fact not been initialized properly. Fix

  this by setting the err variable in xsk_bind so that the socket is not

  set to XSK_BOUND which leads to the clean-up in xsk_release not being

  triggered.
