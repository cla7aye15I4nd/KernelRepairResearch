fix_commit_message: 'nbd: remove nbd->destroy_complete


  The nbd->destroy_complete pointer is not really needed.  For creating

  a device without a specific index we now simplify skip devices marked

  NBD_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT as there is not much point to reuse them.

  For device creation with a specific index there is no real need to

  treat the case of a requested but not finished disconnect different

  than any other device that is being shutdown, i.e. we can just return

  an error, as a slightly different race window would anyway.
