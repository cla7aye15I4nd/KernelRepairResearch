fix_commit_message: 'ANDROID: binder: remove waitqueue when thread exits.


  binder_poll() passes the thread->wait waitqueue that

  can be slept on for work. When a thread that uses

  epoll explicitly exits using BINDER_THREAD_EXIT,

  the waitqueue is freed, but it is never removed

  from the corresponding epoll data structure. When

  the process subsequently exits, the epoll cleanup

  code tries to access the waitlist, which results in

  a use-after-free.


  Prevent this by using POLLFREE when the thread exits.
