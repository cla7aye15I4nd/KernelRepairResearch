fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: pcm: Avoid potential races between OSS ioctls and read/write


  Although we apply the params_lock mutex to the whole read and write

  operations as well as snd_pcm_oss_change_params(), we may still face

  some races.


  First off, the params_lock is taken inside the read and write loop.

  This is intentional for avoiding the too long locking, but it allows

  the in-between parameter change, which might lead to invalid

  pointers.  We check the readiness of the stream and set up via

  snd_pcm_oss_make_ready() at the beginning of read and write, but it''s

  called only once, by assuming that it remains ready in the rest.


  Second, many ioctls that may change the actual parameters

  (i.e. setting runtime->oss.params=1) aren''t protected, hence they can

  be processed in a half-baked state.


  This patch is an attempt to plug these holes.  The stream readiness

  check is moved inside the read/write inner loop, so that the stream is

  always set up in a proper state before further processing.  Also, each

  ioctl that may change the parameter is wrapped with the params_lock

  for avoiding the races.


  The issues were triggered by syzkaller in a few different scenarios,

  particularly the one below appearing as GPF in loopback_pos_update.
