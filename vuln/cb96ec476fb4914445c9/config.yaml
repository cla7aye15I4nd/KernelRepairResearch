fix_commit_message: 'comedi: Fix use of uninitialized data in insn_rw_emulate_bits()


  For Comedi `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions on "digital"

  subdevices (subdevice types `COMEDI_SUBD_DI`, `COMEDI_SUBD_DO`, and

  `COMEDI_SUBD_DIO`), it is common for the subdevice driver not to have

  `insn_read` and `insn_write` handler functions, but to have an

  `insn_bits` handler function for handling Comedi `INSN_BITS`

  instructions.  In that case, the subdevice''s `insn_read` and/or

  `insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the

  `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.


  For `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the

  supplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at

  least exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in

  "comedi_fops.c" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are

  allocated.  However, if `insn->n` is 0 (which is allowable for

  `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain

  uninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a

  different instruction in the array of instructions handled by

  `do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being

  written to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output

  channel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the

  internal saved state of the channel.


  Fix it by returning 0 early if `insn->n` is 0, before reaching the code

  that accesses `data[0]`.  Previously, the function always returned 1 on

  success, but it is supposed to be the number of data samples actually

  read or written up to `insn->n`, which is 0 in this case.
