fix_commit_message: "netfilter: xtables: avoid NFPROTO_UNSPEC where needed\n\nsyzbot\
  \ managed to call xt_cluster match via ebtables:\n\n WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at\
  \ net/netfilter/xt_cluster.c:72 xt_cluster_mt+0x196/0x780\n [..]\n ebt_do_table+0x174b/0x2a40\n\
  \nModule registers to NFPROTO_UNSPEC, but it assumes ipv4/ipv6 packet\nprocessing.\
  \  As this is only useful to restrict locally terminating\nTCP/UDP traffic, register\
  \ this for ipv4 and ipv6 family only.\n\nPablo points out that this is a general\
  \ issue, direct users of the\nset/getsockopt interface can call into targets/matches\
  \ that were only\nintended for use with ip(6)tables.\n\nCheck all UNSPEC matches\
  \ and targets for similar issues:\n\n- matches and targets are fine except if they\
  \ assume skb_network_header()\n  is valid -- this is only true when called from\
  \ inet layer: ip(6) stack\n  pulls the ip/ipv6 header into linear data area.\n-\
  \ targets that return XT_CONTINUE or other xtables verdicts must be\n  restricted\
  \ too, they are incompatbile with the ebtables traverser, e.g.\n  EBT_CONTINUE is\
  \ a completely different value than XT_CONTINUE.\n\nMost matches/targets are changed\
  \ to register for NFPROTO_IPV4/IPV6, as\nthey are provided for use by ip(6)tables.\n\
  \nThe MARK target is also used by arptables, so register for NFPROTO_ARP too.\n\n\
  While at it, bail out if connbytes fails to enable the corresponding\nconntrack\
  \ family.\n\nThis change passes the selftests in iptables.git.\n\nReported-by: syzbot+256c348558aa5cf611a9@syzkaller.appspotmail.com\n\
