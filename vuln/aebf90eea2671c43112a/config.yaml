fix_commit_message: 'udf: Protect rename against modification of moved directory


  When we are renaming a directory to a different directory, we need to

  update ''..'' entry in the moved directory. However nothing prevents moved

  directory from being modified and even converted from the in-ICB format

  to the normal format which results in a crash. Fix the problem by

  locking the moved directory.
