fix_commit_message: "bpf: drop unnecessary user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl\
  \ log\n\nIt's trivial for user to trigger \"verifier log line truncated\" warning,\n\
  as verifier has a fixed-sized buffer of 1024 bytes (as of now), and there are at\n\
  least two pieces of user-provided information that can be output through\nthis buffer,\
  \ and both can be arbitrarily sized by user:\n  - BTF names;\n  - BTF.ext source\
  \ code lines strings.\n\nVerifier log buffer should be properly sized for typical\
  \ verifier state\noutput. But it's sort-of expected that this buffer won't be long\
  \ enough\nin some circumstances. So let's drop the check. In any case code will\n\
  work correctly, at worst truncating a part of a single line output.\n\nReported-by:\
