fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: pcm: Check PCM state at xfern compat ioctl


  Since snd_pcm_ioctl_xfern_compat() has no PCM state check, it may go

  further and hit the sanity check pcm_sanity_check() when the ioctl is

  called right after open.  It may eventually spew a kernel warning, as

  triggered by syzbot, depending on kconfig.


  The lack of PCM state check there was just an oversight.  Although

  it''s no real crash, the spurious kernel warning is annoying, so let''s

  add the proper check.
