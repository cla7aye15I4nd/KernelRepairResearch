fix_commit_message: 'net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration


  Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double

  unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds

  but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.


  The get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number

  but doesn''t assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller

  later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()

  would return the same minor number.


  Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number

  immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor()

  to better reflect what it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index()

  to release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the

  given hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding

  release_minor() call.
