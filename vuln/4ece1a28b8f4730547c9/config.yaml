fix_commit_message: 'mac80211: don''t attempt to rename ERR_PTR() debugfs dirs


  We need to dereference the directory to get its parent to

  be able to rename it, so it''s clearly not safe to try to

  do this with ERR_PTR() pointers. Skip in this case.


  It seems that this is most likely what was causing the

  report by syzbot, but I''m not entirely sure as it didn''t

  come with a reproducer this time.
