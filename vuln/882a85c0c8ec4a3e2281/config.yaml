fix_commit_message: 'USB: usbfs: Don''t WARN about excessively large memory allocations


  Syzbot found that the kernel generates a WARNing if the user tries to

  submit a bulk transfer through usbfs with a buffer that is way too

  large.  This isn''t a bug in the kernel; it''s merely an invalid request

  from the user and the usbfs code does handle it correctly.


  In theory the same thing can happen with async transfers, or with the

  packet descriptor table for isochronous transfers.


  To prevent the MM subsystem from complaining about these bad

  allocation requests, add the __GFP_NOWARN flag to the kmalloc calls

  for these buffers.
