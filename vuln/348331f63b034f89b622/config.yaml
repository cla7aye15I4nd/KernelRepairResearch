fix_commit_message: 'Input: bcm5974 - check endpoint type before starting traffic


  syzbot has found a type mismatch between a USB pipe and the transfer

  endpoint, which is triggered by the bcm5974 driver[1].


  This driver expects the device to provide input interrupt endpoints and

  if that is not the case, the driver registration should terminate.


  Repros are available to reproduce this issue with a certain setup for

  the dummy_hcd, leading to an interrupt/bulk mismatch which is caught in

  the USB core after calling usb_submit_urb() with the following message:

  "BOGUS urb xfer, pipe 1 != type 3"


  Some other device drivers (like the appletouch driver bcm5974 is mainly

  based on) provide some checking mechanism to make sure that an IN

  interrupt endpoint is available. In this particular case the endpoint

  addresses are provided by a config table, so the checking can be

  targeted to the provided endpoints.


  Add some basic checking to guarantee that the endpoints available match

  the expected type for both the trackpad and button endpoints.


  This issue was only found for the trackpad endpoint, but the checking

  has been added to the button endpoint as well for the same reasons.


  Given that there was never a check for the endpoint type, this bug has

  been there since the first implementation of the driver (f89bd95c5c94).
