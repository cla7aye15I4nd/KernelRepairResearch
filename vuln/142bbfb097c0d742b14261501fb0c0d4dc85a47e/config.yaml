fix_commit_message: 'selinux: skip bounded transition processing if the policy isn''t
  loaded


  We can''t do anything reasonable in security_bounded_transition() if we

  don''t have a policy loaded, and in fact we could run into problems

  with some of the code inside expecting a policy.  Fix these problems

  like we do many others in security/selinux/ss/services.c by checking

  to see if the policy is loaded (ss_initialized) and returning quickly

  if it isn''t.
