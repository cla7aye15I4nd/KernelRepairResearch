fix_commit_message: 'mac80211_hwsim: don''t use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM


  We''re obviously not part of a memory reclaim path, so don''t set the flag.


  This also causes a warning in check_flush_dependency() since we end up

  in a code path that flushes a non-reclaim workqueue, and we shouldn''t do

  that if we were really part of reclaim.
