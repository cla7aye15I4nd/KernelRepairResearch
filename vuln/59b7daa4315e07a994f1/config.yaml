fix_commit_message: 'kasan: don''t assume percpu shadow allocations will succeed


  syzkaller and the fault injector showed that I was wrong to assume that

  we could ignore percpu shadow allocation failures.


  Handle failures properly.  Merge all the allocated areas back into the

  free list and release the shadow, then clean up and return NULL.  The

  shadow is released unconditionally, which relies upon the fact that the

  release function is able to tolerate pages not being present.


  Also clean up shadows in the recovery path - currently they are not

  released, which leaks a bit of memory.
