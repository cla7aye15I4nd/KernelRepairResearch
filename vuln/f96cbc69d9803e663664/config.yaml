fix_commit_message: 'mm: memcontrol: fix warning when allocating the root cgroup


  Commit 3e38e0aaca9e ("mm: memcg: charge memcg percpu memory to the

  parent cgroup") adds memory tracking to the memcg kernel structures

  themselves to make cgroups liable for the memory they are consuming

  through the allocation of child groups (which can be significant).


  This code is a bit awkward as it''s spread out through several functions:

  The outermost function does memalloc_use_memcg(parent) to set up

  current->active_memcg, which designates which cgroup to charge, and the

  inner functions pass GFP_ACCOUNT to request charging for specific

  allocations.  To make sure this dependency is satisfied at all times -

  to make sure we don''t randomly charge whoever is calling the functions -

  the inner functions warn on !current->active_memcg.


  However, this triggers a false warning when the root memcg itself is

  allocated.  No parent exists in this case, and so current->active_memcg

  is rightfully NULL.  It''s a false positive, not indicative of a bug.


  Delete the warnings for now, we can revisit this later.
