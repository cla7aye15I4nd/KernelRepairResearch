fix_commit_message: 'fs: move cleanup from init_file() into its callers


  The use of file_free_rcu() in init_file() to free the struct that was

  allocated by the caller was hacky and we got what we deserved.


  Let init_file() and its callers take care of cleaning up each after

  their own allocated resources on error.


  Fixes: 62d53c4a1dfe ("fs: use backing_file container for internal files with "fake"
  f_path") # mainline only
