fix_commit_message: 'netfilter: bridge: ebt_among: add more missing match size checks


  ebt_among is special, it has a dynamic match size and is exempt

  from the central size checks.


  commit c4585a2823edf ("bridge: ebt_among: add missing match size checks")

  added validation for pool size, but missed fact that the macros

  ebt_among_wh_src/dst can already return out-of-bound result because

  they do not check value of wh_src/dst_ofs (an offset) vs. the size

  of the match that userspace gave to us.


  v2:

  check that offset has correct alignment.

  Paolo Abeni points out that we should also check that src/dst

  wormhash arrays do not overlap, and src + length lines up with

  start of dst (or vice versa).

  v3: compact wormhash_sizes_valid() part


  NB: Fixes tag is intentionally wrong, this bug exists from day

  one when match was added for 2.6 kernel. Tag is there so stable

  maintainers will notice this one too.


  Tested with same rules from the earlier patch.
