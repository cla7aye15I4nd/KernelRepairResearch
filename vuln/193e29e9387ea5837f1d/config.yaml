fix_commit_message: 'rxrpc: Fix local endpoint replacement


  When a local endpoint (struct rxrpc_local) ceases to be in use by any

  AF_RXRPC sockets, it starts the process of being destroyed, but this

  doesn''t cause it to be removed from the namespace endpoint list immediately

  as tearing it down isn''t trivial and can''t be done in softirq context, so

  it gets deferred.


  If a new socket comes along that wants to bind to the same endpoint, a new

  rxrpc_local object will be allocated and rxrpc_lookup_local() will use

  list_replace() to substitute the new one for the old.


  Then, when the dying object gets to rxrpc_local_destroyer(), it is removed

  unconditionally from whatever list it is on by calling list_del_init().


  However, list_replace() doesn''t reset the pointers in the replaced

  list_head and so the list_del_init() will likely corrupt the local

  endpoints list.


  Fix this by using list_replace_init() instead.
