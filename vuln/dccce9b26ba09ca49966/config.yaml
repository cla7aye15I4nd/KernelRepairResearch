fix_commit_message: 'y2038: time: avoid timespec usage in settimeofday()


  The compat_get_timeval() and timeval_valid() interfaces are deprecated

  and getting removed along with the definition of struct timeval itself.


  Change the two implementations of the settimeofday() system call to

  open-code these helpers and completely avoid references to timeval.


  The timeval_valid() call is not needed any more here, only a check to

  avoid overflowing tv_nsec during the multiplication, as there is another

  range check in do_sys_settimeofday64().
