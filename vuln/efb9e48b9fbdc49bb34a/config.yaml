fix_commit_message: 'mm,thp: recheck each page before collapsing file THP


  In collapse_file(), for !is_shmem case, current check cannot guarantee

  the locked page is up-to-date.  Specifically, xas_unlock_irq() should

  not be called before lock_page() and get_page(); and it is necessary to

  recheck PageUptodate() after locking the page.


  With this bug and CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS=y, madvise(HUGE)''ed .text

  may contain corrupted data.  This is because khugepaged mistakenly

  collapses some not up-to-date sub pages into a huge page, and assumes

  the huge page is up-to-date.  This will NOT corrupt data in the disk,

  because the page is read-only and never written back.  Fix this by

  properly checking PageUptodate() after locking the page.  This check

  replaces "VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!PageUptodate(page), page);".


  Also, move PageDirty() check after locking the page.  Current khugepaged

  should not try to collapse dirty file THP, because it is limited to

  read-only .text.  The only case we hit a dirty page here is when the

  page hasn''t been written since write.  Bail out and retry when this

  happens.
