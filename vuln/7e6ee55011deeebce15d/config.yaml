fix_commit_message: 'ALSA: pcm: Remove yet superfluous WARN_ON()


  muldiv32() contains a snd_BUG_ON() (which is morphed as WARN_ON() with

  debug option) for checking the case of 0 / 0.  This would be helpful

  if this happens only as a logical error; however, since the hw refine

  is performed with any data set provided by user, the inconsistent

  values that can trigger such a condition might be passed easily.

  Actually, syzbot caught this by passing some zero''ed old hw_params

  ioctl.


  So, having snd_BUG_ON() there is simply superfluous and rather

  harmful to give unnecessary confusions.  Let''s get rid of it.
