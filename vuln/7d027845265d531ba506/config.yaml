fix_commit_message: 'vcs: prevent write access to vcsu devices


  Commit d21b0be246bf ("vt: introduce unicode mode for /dev/vcs") guarded

  against using devices containing attributes as this is not yet

  implemented. It however failed to guard against writes to any devices

  as this is also unimplemented.
