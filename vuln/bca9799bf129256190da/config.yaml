fix_commit_message: 'ext4: avoid race conditions when remounting with options that
  change dax


  Trying to change dax mount options when remounting could allow mount

  options to be enabled for a small amount of time, and then the mount

  option change would be reverted.


  In the case of "mount -o remount,dax", this can cause a race where

  files would temporarily treated as DAX --- and then not.
