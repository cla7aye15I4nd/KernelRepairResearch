fix_commit_message: 'bcachefs: Kill bch2_get_next_backpointer()


  Since for quite some time backpointers have only been stored in the

  backpointers btree, not alloc keys (an aborted experiment, support for

  which has been removed) - we can replace get_next_backpointer() with

  simple btree iteration.
